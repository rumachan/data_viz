    "# What is the right data visualisation for the target audience?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The ideas behind this Notebook are based on some things I picked up in a video called Introduction to Data Visualization by David Taylor https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIgjTuDGXYY, http://dtdata.io/prm/intro_dataviz.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "The essential idea is that there are several distinct target audiences for a data visualisation, in this case four audiences. They are:\n",
    "1. yourself\n",
    "2. your peers\n",
    "3. your superiors, this might be your managers, or the reviewers or editors of a journal where you are trying to publish an article\n",
    "4. everyone else, this is represented by stakeholders and the 'general public'\n",
    "\n",
    "These might be considered the same as 'personas' we'd use in project planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose:\n",
    "To visualise the same data set in four ways, trying to find the best visualisation for the audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Set:\n",
    "This Notebook uses the temperature of Ruapehu Crater Lake recorded by a data logger at the lake as the data set. The data set is restricted to the last year (365 days), just because it's convenient. The data visualised are the daily average temperature values. The data are read from a file so that the visualisation is 'static'.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Message:\n",
    "- Horses for courses. A specific content and style in a visualisation suits a particular audience.\n",
    "- Don't make the visualisation more complex than is necessary, for example for audiences 1 and 2, that are likely to be at least somewhat familiar with the data, don't make a visualisation more complex than is needed, its just a waste of time and effort.\n",
    "- For your superiors and others, who are unlikely to be very knowledgeable about the data being visualised, make sure the visualisation contains enough 'supporting information' that the audience understands your key message.\n",
    "- For others (stakeholders and the general public), don't expect to get away without making a special effort so that the audience understands what you are trying to tell them.\n",
